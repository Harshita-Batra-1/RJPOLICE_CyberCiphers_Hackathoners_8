In the era of rampant misinformation and the proliferation of deepfake technology, there is a critical need for a reliable source verification system for digital media. DeepChain addresses this problem by utilizing blockchain technology to confirm the publishing source and ensure the integrity of content.

DeepChain Solution:

Objective: DeepChain aims to allow users to verify the publishing source and confirm the authenticity of digital media.
Use Cases: Suitable for publishing houses, government announcements, and individual users.
How DeepChain Works:

User Signature: To sign any piece of information (video, image, or audio), users upload it to IPFS (InterPlanetary File System).
Smart Contract: A smart contract signs a transaction containing the Content Identifier (CID) of the file uploaded to IPFS. This creates a proof-of-chain, verifying the publisher and timestamping the content.
Verification Process: Users can share the transaction hash, allowing anyone to verify the information by checking the URI of the media from IPFS and retrieving the original message.
